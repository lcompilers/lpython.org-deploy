      <description>About LPython is a Python compiler that can compile type-annotated Python code to optimized machine code. LPython offers several backends such as LLVM, C, C++, WASM, Julia and x86. LPython features quick compilation and runtime performance, as we show in the benchmarks in this blog. LPython also offers Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and seamless interoperability with CPython.
Based on the novel Abstract Semantic Representation (ASR) shared with LFortran, LPython&amp;rsquo;s intermediate optimizations are independent of the backends and frontends.</description>
